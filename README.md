# 📷 **Human Activity Detection**  
Detect and classify human activities using images and machine learning models! 🎯  

---

## 📜 **Overview**  
Human Activity Detection is a computer vision project that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify various human activities from images. This project demonstrates:  
- 🧠 Neural Network implementation using Keras.  
- 📊 Training and evaluating models on a labeled dataset.  
- 📂 Handling and preprocessing image datasets.

## ✨ **Features**  
- 📦 **Data Preprocessing**: Load, clean, and preprocess image data.  
- 🖼️ **Image Visualization**: Display random samples from the dataset.  
- 🧪 **Model Training**: Train a CNN model with custom architecture.  
- 📋 **Prediction**: Predict activity classes for new images.  
- 📝 **Results Export**: Save predictions to a CSV file.
